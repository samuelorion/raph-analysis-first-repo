## Resources — articles, videos, etc., 

I think it would be a good idea for you to list all the resources I share with you here (again, for future you, and for other people in the lab). 

Like this for example: 

[Welcome — The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) 

> The Turing Way project is open source, open collaboration, and community-driven. We involve and support a diverse community of contributors to make data science accessible, comprehensible and effective for everyone. Our goal is to provide all the information that researchers and data scientists in academia, industry and the public sector need to ensure that the projects they work on are easy to reproduce and reuse.

Notes: Great for learning about global open science practices, to get orientated in a confusing subject. 

[Science as Amateur Software Development - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwRdO9_GGhY) 

> Science is one of humanity's greatest inventions. Academia, on the other hand, is not. It is remarkable how successful science has been, given the often chaotic habits of scientists. In contrast to other fields, like say landscaping or software engineering, science as a profession is largely *unprofessional*—apprentice scientists are taught less about how to work responsibly than about how to earn promotions. This results in ubiquitous and costly errors. Software development has become indispensable to scientific work. I want to playfully ask how it can become even more useful by transferring some aspects of its professionalism, the day-to-day tracking and back-tracking and testing that is especially part of distributed, open-source software development. Science, after all, aspires to be distributed, open-source knowledge development.

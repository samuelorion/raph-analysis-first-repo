## Resources — articles, videos, etc., 

I think it would be a good idea for you to list all the resources I share with you here (again, for future you, and for other people in the lab). 

Like this for example: 

[Welcome — The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) 

> The Turing Way project is open source, open collaboration, and community-driven. We involve and support a diverse community of contributors to make data science accessible, comprehensible and effective for everyone. Our goal is to provide all the information that researchers and data scientists in academia, industry and the public sector need to ensure that the projects they work on are easy to reproduce and reuse.

Notes: Great for learning about global open science practices, to get orientated in a confusing subject. 

[Science as Amateur Software Development - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwRdO9_GGhY) 

> Science is one of humanity's greatest inventions. Academia, on the other hand, is not. It is remarkable how successful science has been, given the often chaotic habits of scientists. In contrast to other fields, like say landscaping or software engineering, science as a profession is largely *unprofessional*—apprentice scientists are taught less about how to work responsibly than about how to earn promotions. This results in ubiquitous and costly errors. Software development has become indispensable to scientific work. I want to playfully ask how it can become even more useful by transferring some aspects of its professionalism, the day-to-day tracking and back-tracking and testing that is especially part of distributed, open-source software development. Science, after all, aspires to be distributed, open-source knowledge development.

[Bioimage Analysis](https://www.ibiology.org/techniques/bioimage-analysis/)

> In this series, Dr. Anne Carpenter and Dr. Kevin Eliceiri provide an overview of bioimage analysis. Pre-processing is the first step that follows image acquisition and will prepare your image by reducing the signal-to-noise ratio, applying appropriate filters to the image, and color extraction. Once you perform pre-processing, you’re ready for segmentation, the process of identifying individual cells or structures within an image. If appropriate for your dataset, you can use tracking to be able to link objects in space and time and measure speed, directionality, and cell division. The last step of bioimage analysis is to analyze the data by measuring different features like the number of cells or biological structures, or their size, shape, intensity or texture. Carpenter and Eliceiri finalize this series by providing tips on best practices that will aid scientists in properly analyzing their data.

Notes: Series of videos that look at pre-processing, segmentation, tracking, measurement.

[Introduction to ImageJ Macro Programming: Variables and operations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ISEWq6q4E)

Notes: Another series of videos showing image analysis, segmentation, macro programming, writing good code.

[Forum image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/)

>Scientific Community Image Forum is a discussion forum for scientific image software sponsored by the Center for Open Bioimage Analysis (COBA).

Notes: Great platform to ask questions


## Next steps 

- Raph use parameter macro
- Run on whole data set with new parameters (WRITE DOWN YOUR PARAMETERS!) (write in your lab book how to do this - with screen shots!!! 
- Next -> modify python script
- Next - analysis and figures! 
- ~~issue with save csv~~
 - still have issue of multiple lines per csv due to multiple objects segmented. Solution - python script to combine into single csv
- ~~set directory~~ 
- ~~run and whole dataset~~
